# OH MY CYGWIN

Looking for a real Terminal for Windows?
Relax you just found it. This sets up a working ZSH Shell powered by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and a package manager powered by [apt-cyg](http://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/).

I took care of installing and configuring some packages so that you have vim, git and ssh one keystroke away under Windows.

# Setup

Install [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) with wget then start cygwin and execute `wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/haithembelhaj/oh-my-cygwin/master/oh-my-cygwin.sh -O - | sh`

Et Voila!
Your windows Terminal will look like this
